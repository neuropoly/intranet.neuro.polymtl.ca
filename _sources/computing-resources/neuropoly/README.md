## Poly-Grames

### Poly-Grames Network Account

A **Poly-Grames** network account is required to have access to various computation resources available in the laboratory.

In order to request a **Poly-Grames** network account you need to have your Polytechnique ID number, which you get during your [onboarding](https://github.com/neuropoly/onboarding/issues).


```{note}
If you want to find out who is behind u/pXXXXXX Grames account, type this:
~~~
getent passwd <GRAMES_ACCOUNT>
~~~
```


### Home folder

Every [GRAMES](../#poly-grames) account has a school-wide personal home folder. It is backed-up nightly.

````{tabbed} macOS
1. Open Finder
2. CMD+K
3. for students:
   1. `smb://hvclusterfs.grames.polymtl.ca/usagers/etudiants/USERNAME`
4. for personnel:
   1. `smb://hvclusterfs.grames.polymtl.ca/usagers/personnels/USERNAME`
````

### Poly-Grames Groups

The list permissions for shared folders on `duke` are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJUUBpiZPl0wxFsUPxkkR6vXZgfSAd3YBK5vlIpf_aA/edit).

### Connect to Poly-Grames Server

Use Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection on creer51, creer52, creer53.

Computer : creer51.grames.polymtl.ca

Username: grames\your_polygrames_username

Password: your_polygrames_password

## List of Computers at NeuroPoly

Are you new to NeuroPoly and looking for a desk and a station? Please check the [list of Desktop/Server/Clusters computers and Printers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11GEh5YvYRnWnERv26TezcyvyPF2W5KF0uoI2U6p7XsM/edit) so you can pick one that is free. If you'd like a particular desk and someone else is using a station remotely, please ask the admins to move the station to another location.

If you prefer to work on your laptop, please let the admins know and we will give you a screen you can connect your laptop to.

## VPN

When working remotely from off-campus you need to use the [VPN](http://www.polymtl.ca/si/reseaux/acces-securise-rvp-ou-vpn).

To connect to the VPN, you need to have an account with √âcole Polytechnique, specifically with [CAS](https://cas5.polymtl.ca/cas/login). Students should already have this. Consultants and Research Associates will need to have an account created for them. This should have happened during your onboarding.

You can change your password at [Gestion des Codes](https://codes.si.polymtl.ca/gestion/). Also, you can double-check you have VPN access by looking for `VPN_* = Actif` here.

The VPN is a Cisco AnyConnect server. For Linux and macOS you can reach it by first installing a VPN client such as `openconnect` (recommended) or `Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client` (if `openconnect` is not available for your OS/distro):


````{tabbed} MacOS
```
brew install openconnect
```

Open your Keychain program and click '+' to add a new item:
- Name: `poly-vpn`
- Account: your `YOUR_CAS_USERNAME` (corresponds to your GRAMES username)
- Password: enter your password here.

Note: the new item has to be added as an `application password` to your `login` Keychain (i.e., not to your `iCloud` Keychain).

Then, create the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# vpn.sh

set -eo pipefail

USER="<YOUR_CAS_USERNAME>"
PASS="$(security find-generic-password -a "${USER}" -s poly-vpn -w)"
GROUP=PolySSL # or PolyInvites, depending on your account's status
echo -n "$PASS" | sudo openconnect -u "$USER" --authgroup "$GROUP" --passwd-on-stdin --reconnect-timeout 20 ssl.vpn.polymtl.ca
```

To connect to the VPN, you need to run:
```
./vpn.sh
```

````

````{tabbed} Linux
```
apt install openconnect
```

Then, create the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# vpn.sh

set -eo pipefail

USER="<YOUR_CAS_USERNAME>"
PASS="<YOUR_CAS_PASSWORD>"
GROUP=PolySSL # or PolyInvites, depending on your account's status
echo -n "$PASS" | sudo openconnect -u "$USER" --authgroup "$GROUP" --passwd-on-stdin ssl.vpn.polymtl.ca
```

To connect to the VPN, you need to run:
```
./vpn.sh
```

````


````{tabbed} Windows

Please follow the official steps from PolyMTL ([French](https://share.polymtl.ca/alfresco/service/api/path/content;cm:content/workspace/SpacesStore/Company%20Home/Sites/rentree/documentLibrary/Aide-m%C3%A9moire%20tutoriels%20A2020/Aide-Memoire_VPN.pdf?a=true&guest=true) or [English](https://share.polymtl.ca/alfresco/service/api/path/content;cm:content/workspace/SpacesStore/Company%20Home/Sites/rentree/documentLibrary/Aide-m%C3%A9moire%20tutoriels%20A2020/Checklist_VPN.pdf?a=true&guest=true).

In case the above links ever break, the steps are:

1. Install "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client".
    - NB: This software is licensed to organizations, so the download page will typically be behind some sort of authentication. Right now, you have to download it from the "Utilisation du Service" section of [this page](https://www.polymtl.ca/si/acces-securise-rvp-ou-vpn), which requries you to sign in with your CAS account.
2. Run the newly-installed Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client program.
3. Configure the VPN:
   * Enter the server address: ssl.vpn.polymtl.ca
   * In the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù drop-down list, choose the profile: PolySSL
   * Identify yourself with the username and password of your CAS account (e.g. p123123)
4. Click "Accept". You're connected! :)

````


## Connect to NeuroPoly Computers

### Locally

To log into a local station at NeuroPoly use your GRAMES account.

### SSH (command line)

Once the VPN connection established, connect via ssh using the `STATION` you want:

```bash
 ssh <POLYGRAMES_USERNAME>@<STATION>.neuro.polymtl.ca
```

Note: For Windows systems, you can[ install Microsoft's ssh package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse), [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/\~sgtatham/putty/), or [cmder](https://cmder.net).

Optionally, this shortcut. It allows you to just type `ssh <STATION>` and be connected:

```bash
cat >~/.ssh/config_neuropoly <<EOF
# GPU servers
Match Host romane,rosenberg,bireli
HostName %h.neuro.polymtl.ca

# CPU servers
Match Host joplin,abbey,tristano
HostName %h.neuro.polymtl.ca

# Workstations
Match Host ferguson,davis
HostName %h.neuro.polymtl.ca

# data servers
Match Host data
HostName %h.neuro.polymtl.ca

Match Host data.neuro.polymtl.ca
User git
PreferredAuthentications publickey

Match host *.neuro.polymtl.ca
User <POLYGRAMES USERNAME> # fill in your username and remove this comment
# passwords are required to access /mnt/duke: https://github.com/neuropoly/computers/issues/90:
PreferredAuthentications password
EOF

echo 'Include ~/.ssh/config_neuropoly' >> ~/.ssh/config
```

Add this to your `~/.ssh/config` to make multiple ssh connections faster and without retyping your password:

```
Host *
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
ControlPersist 3s
```


### SFTP (Mount a remote station)

`ssh` also allows accessing remote files, via [`sftp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).

The best way to do this is `sshfs`, which makes them appear as if they were a drive on your computer:

Install sshfs, if not yet installed:

````{tabbed} Linux
```
sudo apt install -y sshfs
```
````

````{tabbed} mac
```
brew install --cask osxfuse
brew install sshfs
```

```{note}
**If you cannot install osxfuse via Homebrew (you get this error: `installer: Error - The FUSE for macOS installation package is not compatible with this version of macOS.`), try this: https://eengstrom.github.io/musings/install-macfuse-and-sshfs-on-macos-monterey

```

````


Then mount the folder

```
mkdir cluster_folder
sshfs <STATION>: cluster_folder
```

If you use `~` or nothing (as shown) after the `:`, the connection will be relative to to your _remote_ home directory, e.g.

```
sshfs <STATION>:~/project1/ cluster_folder
```

will attach the remote `/home/GRAMES.POLYMTL.CA/$USER/project1/` to the local `./cluster_folder`, and

```
sshfs <STATION>:project1/ cluster_folder
```

will do the exact same.

However if you use `/` after the `:`, the mount will be relative to the _remote root directory_, e.g.

```
sshfs <STATION>:/tmp/ cluster_folder
```

will attach the remote `/tmp/` to the local `./cluster_folder`


```{note}
If you are experiencing mounting issues on macOs, [this]([url](https://github.com/neuropoly/intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/issues/57)) might help.
```


### VNC (graphical interface)


````{tabbed} macOS
1. Open Finder
2. Click Cmd+K
3. In the ‚ÄúServer Address‚Äù, type (using the `STATION` you want): `vnc://STATION.neuro.polymtl.ca`
4. You can use your local/network account information or the [shared account credentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iNhiBKYZWT9ytsvYeeYV4FJn6Wn00q9Ctka7toMV08/edit#heading=h.ckseg5ldklsg)
````

````{tabbed} PC/Linux
1. Establish a VNC connection using [vinaigre](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Vinagre/).
2. In the ‚ÄúServer Address‚Äù, type (using the `STATION` you want): `vnc://STATION.neuro.polymtl.ca`
3. You can use the password from [shared account credentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iNhiBKYZWT9ytsvYeeYV4FJn6Wn00q9Ctka7toMV08/edit#heading=h.ckseg5ldklsg)
````

### Language

The default interface on our systems is fran√ßais. To use another language, set your `LANG` environment variable:

```
echo 'export LANG=en_CA.UTF-8' >> ~/.profile
```

Logout and back in again and apps should now be in English (or the other language code you chose).

#### Linux stations

On Linux targets, a VNC server needs to be started manually before the above instructions will work.

1. Create configuration file under `~/.vnc/xstartup` with the following contents:

```bash
 #!/bin/sh
 # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
 unset SESSION_MANAGER
 unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
 startxfce4 &
 [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
 [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
 xsetroot -solid grey
 vncconfig -iconic &
```

1. Give the right permissions to the file `~/.vnc/xstartup`

```bash
 chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

1. Start VNC server

```bash
 vncserver -geometry 1600x1200 :<PORT_NUMBER>
```

**Note:** To list all running vncservers, use: ps -ef | grep vnc\`

After starting the vncserver, connect to it as above.

```{note}
**Note:**

* On the first start of the vncserver, you will have to set a personal password for your vnc session  
* The resolution can be defined by changing the value of the `-geometry` flag.
```

1. Stop VNC server - mandatory at the end of your session

```bash
 vncserver -kill :<PORT_NUMBER>
```


## CPU/GPU Clusters

The following CPU and GPU clusters are available for internal use at **NeuroPoly**.

```{warning}
**IMPORTANT:** Indicate in the calendar below if you plan to launch intensive calculations on a computer (even if it is on your station, in case you leave for holidays but are still using your station). If you don't have writing permission on this calendar please post a request on Slack #computer.
