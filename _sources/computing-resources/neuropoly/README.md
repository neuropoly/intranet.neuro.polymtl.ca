## GE

A [**GE**](https://www.ge.polymtl.ca/compte-informatique/) network account is required to have access to internal computational resources.

You will receive a GE account during your [onboarding](https://github.com/neuropoly/onboarding/issues).

### Password

```{important}
Once in a while, you are requested to change your password. To do so, log onto another machine (eg `bireli`, `joplin`) and use the command `passwd` to change your password. 
```

### Groups

The list of permissions for shared folders on `duke` are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJUUBpiZPl0wxFsUPxkkR6vXZgfSAd3YBK5vlIpf_aA/edit).

### Connect to Windows Servers

Use Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection on creer51, creer52, creer53.

Computer : creer51.grames.polymtl.ca

Username: grames\your_polygrames_username

Password: your_polygrames_password

## List of Computers at NeuroPoly

Are you new to NeuroPoly and looking for a desk and a station? Please check the [list of Desktop/Server/Clusters computers and Printers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11GEh5YvYRnWnERv26TezcyvyPF2W5KF0uoI2U6p7XsM/edit) so you can pick one that is free. If you'd like a particular desk and someone else is using a station remotely, please ask the admins to move the station to another location.

If you prefer to work on your laptop, please let the admins know in your [onboarding ticket](https://github.com/neuropoly/onboarding/issues/) and they will find you an available screen you can connect to your laptop.

## VPN

When working remotely from off-campus you need to use the [VPN](http://www.polymtl.ca/si/reseaux/acces-securise-rvp-ou-vpn).

To connect to the VPN, you need to have an account with √âcole Polytechnique, specifically with [CAS](https://cas5.polymtl.ca/cas/login). Students should already have this. Consultants and Research Associates will need to have an account created for them. This should have happened during your onboarding.

You can change your password at [Gestion des Codes](https://codes.si.polymtl.ca/gestion/). Also, you can double-check you have VPN access by looking for `VPN_* = Actif` here.

The VPN is a Cisco AnyConnect server. For Linux and macOS you can reach it by first installing a VPN client such as `openconnect` (recommended) or `Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client` (if `openconnect` is not available for your OS/distro):


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} MacOS
```
brew install openconnect
```

Open your Keychain program and click '+' to add a new item:
- Name: `poly-vpn`
- Account: your `YOUR_CAS_USERNAME`
- Password: enter your password here.

Note: the new item has to be added as an `application password` to your `login` Keychain (i.e., not to your `iCloud` Keychain).

Then, create the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# vpn.sh

set -eo pipefail

USER="<YOUR_CAS_USERNAME>"
PASS="$(security find-generic-password -a "${USER}" -s poly-vpn -w)"
GROUP=PolySSL # or PolyInvites, depending on your account's status
echo -n "$PASS" | sudo openconnect -u "$USER" --authgroup "$GROUP" --passwd-on-stdin --reconnect-timeout 20 ssl.vpn.polymtl.ca
```

To connect to the VPN, you need to run:
```
./vpn.sh
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Linux
```
apt install openconnect
```

Then, create the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# vpn.sh

set -eo pipefail

USER="<YOUR_CAS_USERNAME>"
PASS="<YOUR_CAS_PASSWORD>"
GROUP=PolySSL # or PolyInvites, depending on your account's status
echo -n "$PASS" | sudo openconnect -u "$USER" --authgroup "$GROUP" --passwd-on-stdin --reconnect-timeout 20 ssl.vpn.polymtl.ca
```

To connect to the VPN, you need to run:
```
./vpn.sh
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Windows

Please follow the official steps from PolyMTL ([French](https://share.polymtl.ca/alfresco/service/api/path/content;cm:content/workspace/SpacesStore/Company%20Home/Sites/rentree/documentLibrary/Aide-m%C3%A9moire%20tutoriels%20A2020/Aide-Memoire_VPN.pdf?a=true&guest=true) or [English](https://share.polymtl.ca/alfresco/service/api/path/content;cm:content/workspace/SpacesStore/Company%20Home/Sites/rentree/documentLibrary/Aide-m%C3%A9moire%20tutoriels%20A2020/Checklist_VPN.pdf?a=true&guest=true).

In case the above links ever break, the steps are:

1. Install "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client".
    - NB: This software is licensed to organizations, so the download page will typically be behind some sort of authentication. Right now, you have to download it from the "Utilisation du Service" section of [this page](https://www.polymtl.ca/si/acces-securise-rvp-ou-vpn), which requries you to sign in with your CAS account.
2. Run the newly-installed Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client program.
3. Configure the VPN:
   * Enter the server address: ssl.vpn.polymtl.ca
   * In the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù drop-down list, choose the profile: PolySSL
   * Identify yourself with the username and password of your CAS account (e.g. p123123)
4. Click "Accept". You're connected! :)

## Connect to NeuroPoly Computers

### Locally

To log into a desktop station while at NeuroPoly use your GE account.

### SSH (command line)

```{note}
If working off-campus, start your [VPN](#vpn) first.
```

Connect via ssh using the `STATION` you want:

```bash
 ssh <GE_USERNAME>@<STATION>.neuro.polymtl.ca
```

```{note}
To get ssh on Windows, you can [install Microsoft's ssh package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse), [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/\~sgtatham/putty/), or [cmder](https://cmder.net), or [Git-Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
```

Optionally, install this shortcut which allows you to just type `ssh <STATION>`:

```bash
cat >~/.ssh/config_neuropoly <<EOF
Match Host abbey,betty,bireli,coltrane,davis,django,ella,ferguson,jarrett,joplin,kirk,marsalis,mingus,parker,romane,rosenberg,tatum
HostName %h.neuro.polymtl.ca

Match host *.neuro.polymtl.ca
User <GE USERNAME> # fill in your username and remove this comment
# passwords are required to access /mnt/duke: https://github.com/neuropoly/computers/issues/90:
PreferredAuthentications password
EOF

echo 'Include ~/.ssh/config_neuropoly' >> ~/.ssh/config
```

Optionally, add this shortcut which makes simultaneous ssh connections possible without retyping your password:

```
cat >>~/.ssh/config <<EOF
Host *
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
ControlPersist 3s
```


### SFTP (Mount a remote station)

`ssh` also allows accessing remote files, via [`sftp`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).

The best way to do this is `sshfs`, which makes them appear as if they were a drive on your computer:

Install sshfs, if not yet installed:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Linux
```
sudo apt install -y sshfs
```
:::

:::{tab-item} mac (Monterey and after)
Follow [this procedure](https://eengstrom.github.io/musings/install-macfuse-and-sshfs-on-macos-monterey).
:::

:::{tab-item} mac (Before Monterey)
```
brew install --cask osxfuse
brew install sshfs
```
:::
::::

Then mount the folder

```
mkdir cluster_folder
sshfs <USERNAME>@<STATION>: cluster_folder
```

If you use `~` or nothing (as shown) after the `:`, the connection will be relative to to your _remote_ home directory, e.g.

```
sshfs <USERNAME>@<STATION>:~/project1/ cluster_folder
```

will attach the remote `/home/ge.polymtl.ca/$USER/project1/` to the local `./cluster_folder`, and

```
sshfs <USERNAME>@<STATION>:project1/ cluster_folder
```

will do the exact same.

However if you use `/` after the `:`, the mount will be relative to the _remote root directory_, e.g.

```
sshfs <USERNAME>@<STATION>:/tmp/ cluster_folder
```

will attach the remote `/tmp/` to the local `./cluster_folder`


```{note}
If you are experiencing mounting issues on macOs, [this](https://github.com/neuropoly/intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/issues/57) might help.
```


### VNC (graphical interface)


::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} macOS
1. Open Finder
2. Click Cmd+K
3. In the ‚ÄúServer Address‚Äù, type (using the `STATION` you want): `vnc://STATION.neuro.polymtl.ca`
4. You can use your local/network account information or the [shared account credentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iNhiBKYZWT9ytsvYeeYV4FJn6Wn00q9Ctka7toMV08/edit#heading=h.ckseg5ldklsg)
:::

:::{tab-item} PC/Linux
1. Establish a VNC connection using [vinaigre](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Vinagre/).
2. In the ‚ÄúServer Address‚Äù, type (using the `STATION` you want): `vnc://STATION.neuro.polymtl.ca`
3. You can use the password from [shared account credentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iNhiBKYZWT9ytsvYeeYV4FJn6Wn00q9Ctka7toMV08/edit#heading=h.ckseg5ldklsg)
:::
::::

#### Linux stations

On Linux targets, a VNC server needs to be started manually before the above instructions will work.

1. Create configuration file under `~/.vnc/xstartup` with the following contents:

```bash
 #!/bin/sh
 # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
 unset SESSION_MANAGER
 unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
 startxfce4 &
 [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
 [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
 xsetroot -solid grey
 vncconfig -iconic &
```

1. Give the right permissions to the file `~/.vnc/xstartup`

```bash
 chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

1. Start VNC server

```bash
 vncserver -geometry 1600x1200 :<PORT_NUMBER>
```

**Note:** To list all running vncservers, use: ps -ef | grep vnc\`

After starting the vncserver, connect to it as above.

```{note}
**Note:**

* On the first start of the vncserver, you will have to set a personal password for your vnc session  
* The resolution can be defined by changing the value of the `-geometry` flag.
```

1. Stop VNC server - mandatory at the end of your session

```bash
 vncserver -kill :<PORT_NUMBER>
```

### Language

The default interface on our systems is fran√ßais. To use another language, set your `LANG` environment variable:

```
echo 'export LANG=en_CA.UTF-8' >> ~/.profile
```

Logout and back in again and apps should now be in English (or the other language code you chose).



## CPU/GPU Clusters

The following CPU and GPU clusters are available for internal use at **NeuroPoly**.

```{warning}
Please indicate in [NeuroPoly's "Computer resource" calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=4mg6bgd9pv55thf9486t2miht8@group.calendar.google.com) if you plan to launch intensive calculations on a computer. These are shared resources, so it helps to know which computer is being used and by who, in order to prioritize tasks and make the best of our resources. Your calendar entry could span several days, and should specify your name and the ID or number of GPU/CPU used. Example: `julien@rosenberg:gpu[4,5]`, or `naga@joplin:cpu[n=20]` If you don't have writing permission on this calendar please post a request on [the ticket tracker](https://github.com/neuropoly/computers/issues/).
```

## Scheduled reboots

Each computer has a regular unattended upgrade that forces a reboot once a week. The date and time of the next reboot will be indicated in a message when you log in. Do try and consider this when starting your computations. If you started a long computation that you think will be interupted by the scheduled reboot, you can contact neuropoly-admin@liste.polymtl.ca to request that the reboot be exceptionally delayed.

**Admins**: Documentation on the standard operating procedure for delaying scheduled reboots is described [here](https://github.com/neuropoly/computers/blob/master/docs/unattended-upgrades.md).

## Admin

Technical details about station management and documentation is found on [this repository](https://github.com/neuropoly/computers).
