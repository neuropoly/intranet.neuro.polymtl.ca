To publish a seminar or other meeting held by the lab:

1. Ask the organizer to record the meeting.
2. Once the meeting is done, ask the organizer to forward you the download link for the video.
3. Download the video and open it in QuickTime player.

    A general rule is to cut out the discussions at the end of the presentation.
