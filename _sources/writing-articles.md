## Writing Platforms

### Google Docs

Google Doc is great for collaborating on a paper. We recommend you install (and use) the following Adds-on:

| Add-on                                                                                          | **Purpose**                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Cross Reference](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/cross\_reference/269114033347)   | Cross-referencing figures on Google Docs                                             |
| [Markdown Tools](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/markdown\_tools/788541604518) | Enables adding heading numbers and the creation of a table of contents for markdown. |

### Overleaf

Overleaf is a good platform for writing papers with Latex. Mila provides the [Overleaf Pro license](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/mila#overview) for its students. If you're Julien's student, please contact him to get you added to Mila's account. Then, send an email to `it-support@mila.quebec` requesting an Overleaf Pro license. Having access to the Pro license enables the 'tracking' mode in Overleaf, which is essential when collaborating on a paper with multiple authors.

## Reference manager

### Paperpile

If you write your article with Google Doc, we recommend using [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com) for managing your bibliography.

We have a Paperpile account for the lab. For login please use the Google account `neuropolylab "at" gmail "dot" com`

If you prefer to have your own Paperpile license please request it to your supervisor.

```{note}
Paperpile on Google Docs works only with Google Chrome.
```

To install Paperpile:

1. Connect to [Paperpile website](https://paperpile.com) with the NeuroPoly Google account (or with your account if you have a license). Sometimes if you only have a single Google account logged in, you will have to add another account here: [https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser?service=lso](https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser?service=lso)
2. Install Paperpile chrome extension on the browser (Google Chrome)
3. Use your personal account to connect on Google Docs, start a new document page. Insert citations, when you do Paperpile/Format citations/ it will require you to authorize Paperpile into Google docs.
4. Authorize Paperpile on Google using your personal account.

## Figures (in vectorial format)

Create and manage figures:

* make your figure in **Keynote** (or **Power Point**)
* keep only one keynote file
* number the slide for a specific fig, eg.: slide 1 –> fig 1, slide 2 –> fig 2. The material/old slides go after a big slide called “OLD”.
* when using phantom and MRI data please indicate the session number, slice, TE, etc. anything so we can reproduce the figure in the future.

Incorporate figure in article:

* Export all your figures into a single PDF document (select: best quality).
* Open PDF with **Preview**
* Tools > Rectangular selection
* CMD+c, CMD+n
* Save figure
* Import your figure into Word and use “crop” tool.
* 
## Organizing Folders

![](.gitbook/assets/phd101212s.gif)

Recommended file structure (hosted under google drive):

```
manuscripts/
     |- 2017_MRM/
           |- README --> google document that indicates everything that needs to be known in order to be able to reproduce results, figures, etc. that includes: link to GitHub repository (which itself should have a README with 'getting started' instructions), link to data repository (if exists) and the version of the data used (ideally this should be indicated in the article itself).
           |- fig/
               |- figures.key (or pptx) --> all your figures, one per slide
           |- r0/
               |- cover_letter_r0.docx --> this is a microsoft Word
               |- awesome_study_manuscript_r0 --> google doc document, other co-authors can edit with 'suggestion' mode
               |- awesome_study_reviewer_suggestions
           |- r1/
               |- awesome_study_manuscript_r1 --> copy awesome_study_manuscript_r0 into this 'r1' folder and 'lock' manuscript_r0 for edition. Now, everyone should work on this version r1.
               |- awesome_study_responses_to_reviews --> copy/paste reviewers comments, above each comment, indicate a sub-section 'RXCY' with X: reviewer numbers and Y: comment number. Then, in the manuscript, add a comment with this tag. Example: R1C4.
```

[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bIZCpsyqr2RBlJLq_WvP0xcmkHxMOeiS?usp=sharing) is an example of manuscript folder/files organization.


## Cover letter

Excellent [recommendations](https://twitter.com/drbreaky/status/1385863882816647169?s=27) from Michael Breakspear on how to write a cover letter.

## Addressing Reviewer Comments

* Copy/paste comments in a new file `responses_to_reviews`
* Address comments point-by-point
* For most comments, the manuscript will need to be updated and the modified text copied in the responses. Please **do not** duplicate this text during the review process, because the manuscript might be edited later by another coauthor, and there will be discrepancies between the manuscript and the responses. Therefore, edit the manuscript first, and in the responses, indicate a placeholder with a comment “will be copy/pasted when final version of the manuscript is ready”.
* Please read these [ten simple rules for writing a response to reviewers](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005730).
