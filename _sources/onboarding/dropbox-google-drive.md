# Google Drive

If you are a student, please create a Google Drive folder and share it with your supervisor. [Here is an template you can copy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11HRjztZkaU2SZsglE5OCQO03PAeAoVBb). The folder should include the following:

| Folder | Description  |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `Name - Progress Report` | Google doc listing progress report. |
| `Admin/` | administrative stuff such as Polytechnique documents, grades, CV |
| `Biblio/` | not ALL your biblio, but some interesting stuff that we exchange temporarily |
| `Conferences/` | subfolder prefix is the date of the event, e.g. **`20150530_ISMRM/`** |
| `Fellowships/` | subfolder prefix is the date of the deadline, e.g. **`20150314_FRQS/`** |
| `Manuscripts/` | subfolder name is year of first submission + journal, e.g. `2015_neuroimage`. Inside the folder, please follow [this organization](https://intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/writing-articles.html#organizing-folders). |
| `Reports/` | Include progress reports (format: Google Slides, pptx, keynote or pdf). Google Slides are preferred because comments can easily be added. Prefix name should start with YYYYMMDD\_. Example: **`20170515_report.pptx`** |
| `Results/` | Snapshots/results of your experiments. Prefix should start with YYYYMMDD. Example: **`20150120_dmri_nogse/`** |

```{note}
For students doing an internship, you will only need to create the `admin`, `biblio`, and `reports` folders.
```

**GENERAL RULES:**

* NEVER USE SPACE OR ACCENTS IN FILE NAMES! (Unix-unfriendly).
* Date format should always be `YYYYMMDD` (or `YYYY-MM-DD`). See this: [https://xkcd.com/1179/](https://xkcd.com/1179/)

P.S. For projects involving multiple students, a ‚Äúproject‚Äù folder is created under **`Google Drive/NeuroPoly/Projects`**.
