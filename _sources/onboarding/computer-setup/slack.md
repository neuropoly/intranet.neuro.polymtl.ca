# `🗣` Slack

Slack is used for rapid communication. Please make sure to browse all the channels regularly and feel free to subscribe to any channels you like. 

Communication should be respectful. 

When a task is requested to you (via a tag), please indicate that you got the notification (with 👍), and once the task is done please indicate (with ✅). That way, things don't slip through the cracks.
