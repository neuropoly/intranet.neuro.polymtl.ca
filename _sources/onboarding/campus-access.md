# Campus Access

### Please advise one of the PIs before arriving for the first time on campus in order to organize the logistics together.

### Campus Map

### Lab rooms at Polytechnique

As a NeuroPoly lab member, the majority of your time at Polytechnique will be spent in one of two main rooms, depending on the focus of your work:

* L-5613: Primarily for those working on RF/hardware/shimming projects.
* L-5626: Primarily for those working on image analysis/deep learning projects.

There are also separate rooms for servers (L-7944.A) and printers (L-5619). Some of these doors require codes to access, these can be found in the [Internal Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iNhiBKYZWT9ytsvYeeYV4FJn6Wn00q9Ctka7toMV08/edit#heading=h.o24dt0r1154g).

### Desk/computer access

Desk access is given on a first-come-first-serve basis. Once you find a seat that you like, please put your name somewhere \(e.g. on a sheet of paper\) so we know that a desk has been claimed.

If you work on a personal laptop and need desktop equipment (a monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc.) please contact your supervisor. If instead you need to be provided a workstation (e.g. iMac), please consult the [List of Computing Resources](https://intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/computing-resources/neuropoly/README.html) document, then pick a workstation that is not being used by another lab member. 

### Requirements for room access

To be able to access the lab rooms, you will need a Polytechnique card and to activate it for the specific rooms you wish to access. To activate it, please follow the onboarding procedure.

### COVID-19 Protocol

In addition to the above requirement, please also complete the following steps specific to COVID-19:

* Check-in with your supervisor if you have any plans to come on campus, as you will need to be authorized first.
* Read over the [NeuroPoly Lab Reopening guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JtJLcgdA7aXuxRHIzu1hN_lLjYK8PI0BKa0OK-155TE/edit#slide=id.p1) to learn about the mandatory training procedures that are necessary for returning to the lab.
* Check the pinned messages in the [\#covid-19 ](https://app.slack.com/client/T034UD4QN/C015YFVFWJC) channel on NeuroPoly's Slack for the most up-to-date info, as the situation is likely to change as the pandemic evolves.
