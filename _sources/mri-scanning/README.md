## MRI facilities

A list of MRI facilities accessible to NeuroPoly members is available [here](https://neuropoly.gitbook.io/workspace/facilities#mri-facilities).&#x20;

## **Book the scanner and log in the google calendar **

If you book the MRI, please use the ‚Äú[Neuropoly - MRI](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=k4moiei5d2lh84iokouk6lt84o%40group.calendar.google.com\&ctz=America%2FToronto)‚Äù google cal. 
Create an event in the gcal, with:
* Event name = scan session name, as will be entered on the console (eg, if your scan is acdc_spine_7t_033p, call the even the same)
* Event description: Write a description into rthe logbook (see below) and link that entry, then add location (MNI, UNF, etc)
* Invities: if other people are joining you in the scan session, invite them as a courtesy/reminder 

Details to book an MRI scanner is given in the specific MRI sub-section.&#x20;

## **Log book**

During scanning, please keep a log of your experiment:

## Pay a participant?

* Pay the participant via _Interac_ transfer or cash, or ask Alexandru Foias to do the payment. The person doing the payment will have to complete the compensation form.
* The person doing the payment can be reimbursed by sending the compensation form to `dge.sec-biomedical@polymtl.ca`. Note that you can ask to be reimbursed multiple payments at once (more time efficient).\
