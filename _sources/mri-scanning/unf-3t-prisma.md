## Booking the scanner

Details about the booking system [here](https://unf-montreal.ca/en/documentation/facility/reservation/).

```{note}
Under the `session name` you will need to enter a study suffix that is listed in this [JSON file](https://github.com/UNFmontreal/bids_configs/blob/master/studies.json). Look for the fields that start with `neuropoly`.
```


## Finding participants

Check our [internal list of participants](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S0v-YWxYrILJmqb3PtaSTgwBECKEbnljoDfnfIROoSk/edit?usp=sharing) (requires NeuroPoly credentials).

## Filling MRI eligibility form

Have your participant fill the MRI eligibility form, which is accessible once the MRI slot is booked (the person who booked the scanner knows how to access this form).
