**What size should my poster be?**

The template provided **might not be the right size for you**. The size of your poster depends on the conference requirements \(usually listed on their website, or given to you by email\). Typically you want to print ~ 5cm smaller to make sure it fits on the board.

**Important**: respect the proportion of your poster when you export it to pdf. Do not add white bands on the side. E.g., if your poster is set to 1000×2000 voxels, then export to pdf with a ratio of 1:2.

If you wish to use your poster for several conferences, then print it in a way so that it fits the requirement of each conference \(e.g. if Conference \#1 asks for 30x20 inches and Conference \#2 asks for 25x28 inches, then print your poster at 23x18 inches\).

The reprography allows any size under 60 inches.

**Where to print your poster?**

- Polytechnique Montreal Reprography, 2nd floor, main building, Order directly online using the form \(pay upon receipt\): [http://www.polymtl.ca/reprographie/](http://www.polymtl.ca/reprographie/)
- University of Montreal, http://www.sium.umontreal.ca/
- https://www.graphiscan.com/ (complicated, asks for a quote, etc.)

**Detailed how-to guide when printing your poster at Poly**

For first-timers printing a poster, there might be a lot of things to consider (file types: pngs, pdfs, dpi settings, etc.). This gives a quick how-to on what settings to use for quick hassle-free poster printing. Note: This guide of MacOS users, there are similar options in PowerPoint for Windows.

Firstly, note that the images need to be at 300 dots/inch (DPI) to look good on a poster. When you're making a poster on Keynote, there are two options to save your poster: (1) Exporting it directly as a pdf and (2) Exporting it as "Images" in a PNG or any other image format. Depending on what on your conference requires, you might need to do both. 

When exporting directly as a PDF (option 1):

* Keynote, by default, saves your PDF in a very high resolution. So, when sending the poster for printing at Poly, you can directly upload this PDF and then specify the size of the poster you want it to be printed on. 

  * One way to check whether the resolution of your PDF is good is the following: (i) Open the PDF on Preview, (ii) Go to Export and save it as a JPEG with highest quality, while also increasing the resolution to 300 DPI. This JPEG figure should contain crisp images when zoomed in to the actual size. 

When exporting directly as an Image (option 2):

* This option is useful only when the conference wants you upload a PNG (or any image format) of your poster. Note that with Keynote, when slides are converted to images, the resolution automatically is set to 72 DPI. 
  
  * **What NOT to do?** The actual poster should typically contain images with 300 DPI, so simplying changing the resolution by resampling from 72 to 300 DPI will make your figures look blurry when printed on paper. 
  * So, to avoid this, refer to Option 1 and save your poster directly as a PDF instead.

Options to choose when filling out Poly's [Service de la reprographie form](https://www.polymtl.ca/reprographie/formulaires/impression/):

1. Type de client - etudiant
2. Type d'assemblage - aucun assemblage (no assembly)
3. Impression - en couleur (in colour)
4. Choix d'impression - recto seulement (front only)
5. Format - select "grand format" (this means the printing is for a poster)
   * Type de papier - mat (for a matte, lightweight paper (the standard for posters))
   * po. (i.e. pouces) - size of the poster (in inches). Check your conference's requirements for this.

**How to pay?**

They only accept cash. You have two payment options:

1. You pay cash when you get your poster and get the refund from the lab afterwards, on conference spending.
2. You fulfill the form “Demande au centre de reprographie” available at Marie-Claude Nadeau office \(M-5405\) and give it when you get your poster.

**QR Code on the poster**

Public access to the Spinal Cord Toolbox ([https://spinalcordtoolbox.com](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com)) can be provided on the poster using this QR Code \(download the original image \(2000×2000\) to add to your poster\):

## Reimbursement

The typical policy of the lab is that you can get your conference subscription reimbursed if you have something to present. If you don't, please ask your supervisor if they can reimburse the attendance.

You are reimbursed for:

* registration fees. Note: The lab will only reimburse the cost of early fee. If you register late, you will have to pay the difference.
  * for ISMRM: make sure to be a student member– it reduces the overall cost of the conference– and make sure to do it AHEAD OF TIME (not last minute)
* transport
* housing

You are not reimbursed for:

* food

You can be reimbursed by two means:

**A priori (travel advance)**

Send an email to `dge.sec-biomedical@polymtl.ca` and ask them for a travel advance.

The amount of the advance is an estimate of all your eligible conference fees \(see above\).

Keep all your receipts and bank statement information \(if using debit or credit card\).

Once the conference is over, you have one month to claim the refunds.

**A posteriori**

Keep all your receipts and bank statement information\(if using debit or credit card\).

Once the conference is over, send an email to `dge.sec-biomedical@polymtl.ca` with all your receipts.

N.B. You can not be reimbursed for expenses incurred before the conference. If you wish, ask for a travel advance.
