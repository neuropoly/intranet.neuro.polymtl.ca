# Getting Started

When you join the lab, a GitHub issue in our [onboarding repository](https://github.com/neuropoly/onboarding/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22onboarding+%F0%9F%9A%80%22)
will be created to track your onboarding progress. That issue will contain all
of the steps needed for access to the various accounts and services you will use.

## Key People

If ever you need help with accounts or onboarding, feel free to reach out to
Alexandru \(Alex\) Foias or Taowa Rosetwig via Slack.
