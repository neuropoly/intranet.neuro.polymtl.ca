# GitHub

#### Organisation

NeuroPoly has a github organisation:
https://github.com/neuropoly

#### Purpose


The purpose of this organization is to host repos that are related to NeuroPoly's projects. Eg: if you publish a paper, you could put the code+data there and link to it in your paper.

#### Philosophy

The philosophy of NeuroPoly's lab is to do open science, which means that repos should be public. There are some exception: confidential data/credentials, highly-top-secret scientific research, etc.

#### Usage

If you decide to make your repos private, please make sure to not go above the total size and [BW limits](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/about-billing-for-git-large-file-storage#purchasing-additional-storage-and-bandwidth)

```{note}
For students, please always ask your supervisor before creating a repos.
