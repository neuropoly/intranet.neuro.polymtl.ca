#       that internally renamed README -> index during the writing, but only internally.
#       but unless we special-cased something hat would break the edit_page_button.
# TODO: Another solution is to host on that lets us use .htaccess files to choose README.md as index pages
# TODO: Another solution is to decide not to care about auto-rendering index pages on github.
