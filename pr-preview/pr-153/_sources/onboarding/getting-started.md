# Getting Started

When you join the lab, a GitHub issue in our [onboarding repository](https://github.com/neuropoly/onboarding/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22membership-card%22)
will be created to track your onboarding progress. That issue will contain all
of the steps needed for access to the various accounts and services you will use.

## Get help

If ever you need help with accounts or onboarding, reach out to your onboarding lead.
As the person assigned to your onboarding ticket, they are there to be a friendly resource
to welcome you into the lab and point you in the right directions.

As you are more familiar with the lab you will probably run into issues and oversights in our systems.
Please submit these as tickets to the relevant GitHub projects. For general lab infrastructure,
post your problems in the [computers](https://github.com/neuropoly/computers/issues/) repository
so that their solutions can benefit everyone.
