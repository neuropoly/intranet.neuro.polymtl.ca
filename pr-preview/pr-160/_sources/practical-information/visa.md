# <span>ðŸŒŽ</span> VISAs and Work Permits

## Internships

To be eligible for an internship \("stage"\), the student must be registered in a program of study in their home country.

* The internship is &lt; 120 days: You don't need a work permit

* The internship is &gt;= 120 days: You will need to get a work permit \(document fÃ©dÃ©ral\). To get a work permit, you will need to have a "Certificat d'Acceptation du Quebec" \(CAQ, provincial document\). However, an exemption for CAQ is possible in 2 cases:
  * You are eligible to participate in the [Programme ExpÃ©rience Internationale Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/iec/apply-work-permit.html), which allows you to get a work permit specific for internships \(stagiares\), without needing CAQ
  * Your school has a partnership with Ecole Polytechnique Montreal

To apply for a work permit, you will need to have a letter of invitation from Polytechnique. You will receive this letter after you have filled out the internship form. To fill out the form, I suggest putting the start/end dates a bit earlier/later than your internship. For example, start 3 weeks before your internship starts, and end 3 weeks after; this will give you time to settle in \(the dates of your work permit are based on this invitation letter\).

It should take around 8 weeks to get your work permit.

## Postdocs

You will need a work permit. For further information contact the postdoc association at Polytechnique: assep.postdoc@gmail.com
