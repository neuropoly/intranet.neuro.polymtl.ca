# CPU Clusters

As with [other machines](./README.md#connect-to-neuropoly-computers), connect with ssh using your [GE](./README.md#ge) account.

## `joplin`

| Spec | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | 64-core CPU |
| **OS** | Linux |
| **Hostname** | `joplin.neuro.polymtl.ca` |

For fast I/O, use the NVMe hard drive, which is automatically available: `~/data_nvme_$USER`

### `abbey`

| Spec | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | Xeon 12-core |
| **OS** | Linux |
