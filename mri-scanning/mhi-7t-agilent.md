## Technical Specifications

### Characteristics <a id="characteristics"></a>

**Larmor frequency:** 299.94MHz

#### 305/210 HD Gradient Coil <a id="hd_gradient_coil"></a>

ACTIVELY SHIELDED GRADIENTS AND SHIMS. The gradient is water cooled to allow for high duty cycle experiments. The room temperature shim set has been specifically designed to minimize coupling between gradients and shims during pulsing. The gradient set is fully vacuum impregnated to minimize mechanical vibration and noise.

**Outer Diameter:** 305 mm  
**Internal Diameter:** 210 mm  
**Gradient strength:** Maximum at 300 A: 300 mT/m  
**Duty cycle at 300mT/m:** 14%  
**Rise time to 98% of max gradient at 300V:** 638 microseconds  
**Linearity over 120 mm dsv:** 5% \(X/Y/Z\)  
**Shim configuration:** extra strong 2nd order

#### 205/120 HD Gradient Coil <a id="hd_gradient_coil1"></a>

ACTIVELY SHIELDED GRADIENTS AND SHIMS The gradient is water cooled to allow for high duty cycle experiments.
