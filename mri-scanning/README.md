# 🧲  MRI Scanning

## MRI facilities

A list of MRI facilities accessible to NeuroPoly members is available [here](https://neuropoly.gitbook.io/workspace/facilities#mri-facilities). 

## **Book the scanner**

If you book the MRI, please use the “[Neuropoly - MRI](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=k4moiei5d2lh84iokouk6lt84o%40group.calendar.google.com\&ctz=America%2FToronto)” google cal. Details to book an MRI scanner is given in the specific MRI sub-section. 

## **Log book**

During scanning, please keep a log of your experiment:

* [MRI Acquisition Log 2020](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YqSS7ZC2LcPiDEyRfaXpCNyvHEjOPbB5OpELdMt9S1M/edit)
* [MRI Acquisition Log 2019](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8H2KxZ5NNIPmhCu9VIDr34VgskPOHVJBfOqMX7BHR8/edit)
* [MRI Acquisition Log 2018](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AgnNL4Kl51Cl8J2h5VJhzOpB3O1EUrWy8\_mgb7dbvVA/edit#heading=h.hubt91p52z5p)

## Pay a participant?

* Have the participant fill [this compensation form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJw3trkPCvQSfN9paHt5WmiatLp8jmCI/view?usp=sharing) (the editable document is located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b9O_sCaBzGxk97TPMjdBlS7biZnwC7Dl)).
* Pay the participant via _Interac_ transfer or cash, or ask Alexandru Foias to do the payment. The person doing the payment will have to complete the compensation form.
* The person doing the payment can be reimbursed by sending the compensation form to `dge.sec-biomedical@polymtl.ca`. Note that you can ask to be reimbursed multiple payments at once (more time efficient).\
