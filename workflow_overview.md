# 📄 General Overview of Project Workflow

Once your [onboarding](https://intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/onboarding/README.html) is complete, you will be ready to tackle your project!

## 🖥️ Setting up 🖥️

**Step 1.**
* Make sure that your VPN connection is established or that you are connected to the Polytechnique wifi.

**Step 2.**
* Log in to one of the available [Neuropoly compute nodes](https://intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/computing-resources/neuropoly/README.html):
```
ssh <POLYGRAMES_USERNAME>@<STATION>.neuro.polymtl.ca
```

**Step 3.**
* Create your project working directory:
```
cd data_nvme_<POLYGRAMES_USERNAME>
mkdir <PROJECT_NAME>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
```

**Step 4. Developing version-controlled software**
* Ideally, you are working on code in Github repository (either a branch of an existing repo, or a new one that you created).
* After adding your NeuroPoly workstation [SSH key to your Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux), you are ready to make a local fork of that remote repository:
```
cd data_nvme_<POLYGRAMES_USERNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>
git clone -b "<YOUR_WORKING_BRANCH>" git@github.com:<REPOSITORY>.git
```

**Step 5. The data**
* It is critical to make sure that you know what data you are working with. 
* Ideally, it should be in [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) format on the [`data.neuro`](https://intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/data/git-datasets.html) storage node: `data.neuro:datasets/<PROJECT_DATASET>`.
* Thanks to `git annex`, the following command will copy the directory structure and some small files of your dataset on `data.neuro`:
```
cd data_nvme_<POLYGRAMES_USERNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>
git clone git@data.neuro.polymtl.ca:datasets/<PROJECT_DATASET> 
```

## 🌊 Workflow 🌊

### ⌨️ Code
Any changes you make to the code should be added in small commits and pushed to your github branch.

### 💿 Data
* If you need to access your data files directly, you can use `git annex` to download the larger files to the [Neuropoly computer](https://intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/computing-resources/neuropoly/README.html) you are working from:
```
cd data_nvme_<POLYGRAMES_USERNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/<PROJECT_DATASET> 
git annex get .
```
* However, in order to save space, make sure to "undownload" those big files once you are done working with them with:
```
git annex drop .
```
* Any data derivatives that you output should be added to `data.neuro:datasets/<PROJECT_DATASET>` according to the [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) data standard! More documentation on how to version control your data on `data.neuro` can be found [here](https://intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/data/git-datasets.html#update).
